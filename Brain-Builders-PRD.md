## Document Summary

This Product Requirements Document captures the complete vision for Brain Builders as designed by Praptini (age 10) with input from her parent. The requirements reflect what a real child wants in an educational app - engagement, rewards, fun characters, and social features - while maintaining the learning outcomes parents need.

**Key success factors**: The app must be **ENGAGING** above all else. If it's boring, children will stop using it. Every feature should contribute to making learning feel like play.
