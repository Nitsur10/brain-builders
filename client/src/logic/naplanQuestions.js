    "question": "[Passage: Why Pets Should Be Allowed in Schools]\nMany schools have strict rules against bringing pets to class, but I believe this should change. Studies show that animals can reduce stress and anxiety in students. When children interact with animals, they learn responsibility and compassion. Some might argue that pets would be distracting, but with proper rules, classroom pets could enhance learning rather than disrupt it. Imagine how much more engaged students would be during a science lesson about animal habitats if they could observe a real animal!\n\nQuestion: Which word could best replace 'enhance' in this passage?",
